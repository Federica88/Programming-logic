    <p>
    Odysseus visited 14 places during his journey back to Ithaca.
    
    <br>
    
    <bold>TROY</bold>
    
    <br>
    His journey begins at the end of the Trojan War in Troy.
    After the Achaean won the war, Odysseus and his men left Troy towards their homeland Ithaca.
    </p>
    <br>
    <bold>ISMAROS- LAND OF CICONES</bold>
    <br>
    <p>Odysseuy went to this island in order to find water and food for himself and for his men.
    Unfortunately he made a mistake when he took over the city and got all the food and the water.
     He made the Gods, who were watching him, very angry. </p>
    <br>
    <bold>THE ISLAND OF THE LOTUS EATERS</bold>
    <br>
    <p>After odysseus and his men left Ismaros, they arrived on the Island Of Lotus Eaters.
    Odysseus decided to sent some men to reconnoitre the aerea trying to find some food.
    The men met the Lotus Eaters who gave them a drink with the nectar of the Lotus flower in it. That nectar had the power to make whoever drinks it lose all the desire to leave the island.
    Odysseus realized that his men were gone for too long so he went to find them and when he did find them,he needed to tie them up to make them want to leave that place and going home! They went back to the ship and left.</p>
    <br>
    <bold>THE ISLAND OF THE CYCLOPS</bold>
    <br>
    <p>When Odysseus and his men ended up on the island they were wondering who might lived there, so they started looking around until they found a cave.
    They met Polyphemus, a cyclops, who trapped them inside the cave pushing a slab in front of the door.
    The cyclops noticed Odysseus and his men and asked them who they were and where they were from.
    Odysseus claimed that is name was Nobody from Troy and that his ship crashed on the rocks of the island. 
    Polyphemus started eating some men and so did the morning after.
     When the creature got out to get some wood for the fire, Odysseus came up with a plan.
     When the cyclops came back, the man offered him some wine; 
     Polyphemus accepted the wine and passed out.
    At that point Odysseus stabbed Polyphemus in the eye with a spear, the cyclops woke up and he was blind!
    When finally Odysseus and his men were outside of the cave, he yelled at the cyclops saying 
    " I, Odysseus of Ithaca, fooled the cyclops, Polyphemus".
    Polyphemus cursed him making his journey back home harder.
    </p>
    <br>
    <bold>AEOLIA-THE ISLAND OF AEOLUS</bold>
    <br>
    <p>After leaving the island of cyclops, they ended up on the island of Aeolus, the Wind God.
    The God gave a bag full of all the west winds to Odysseus.
    The bag was not to be opened until they get back to Ithaca.
    They curiosity of the Odysseus's men to see what was inside the bag was stronger than staying at Odysseus's commands; they thought their master was keeping gold to himself,so they opened it up.
    This made the journey harder and longer.</p>
    <br>
    <bold>TELEPYLOS-LAND OF THE LAESTRYGONIANS</bold>
    <br>
    <p>When the storm caused by the opening of the winds bag was over, the Odysseus's ship landed on a new island.
     Telepylos,the land of Laestrygonians.
    Three men went to explore the land and they ran into the King of Laestrygonians who ate all of them.
    When Odysseus realized what was happening, he gave the order to his men to go back to their ship as fast as possible. So they left!</p>
    <br>
    <bold>AEAEA-CIRCE'S ISLAND</bold>
    <br>
    <p>When they arrived on the island, Odysseus sent half of his men to look for someone who could give them food and water.
     That island was the home of Circe, the enchantress.
      The men who were sent to get food, heard her singing and decided to follow the voice. 
      They ended up to Circe's house, full of animals. Circe fed the soldiers and turned them into pigs. Only one escaped and told Odysseus what happened.
    Odysseus decided to go to Circe's house to save his men, on the way he met Hermes who gave him a magical flower that could keep him protected from the enchantress's spell!
    When he arrived to Circe's house, she offered him the drugged wine and he drank it with no esitation.
     She was surprised when he didn't turn into an animal. Odysseus asked Circe to set his men free, she agreed after they made love. They spent one year on the Circe's island and when the time come,Odysseus asked Circe some help to get back home. She told him that first he needed to go to the underworld and look for Tiresias. </p>
    <br>
    <bold>THE UNDERWORLD-LAND OF THE DEAD</bold>
    <br>
    <p>When Odysseus and his men got to the Underworld, Odysseus entered it alone.
     As Circe told him to do, he started looking for Tiresias, but in order to find him he had to sacrifice and ewe and a lamb.
     Odysseus had also to fight off the spirits but eventually he found Tiresias who told him how to get home.
     On the way back, Odysseus saw his mum's spirit,he talked to her for while trying to find out how she died and why. 
     Then he left to continue his journey.</p>
    <br>
    <bold>THE ISLAND OF THE SIRENS</bold>
    <br>
    <p>Circe warned Odysseus of the Sirens and their power, so when he got to the island he was aware of what he was about to deal with. 
    With their singing, the sirens could cause the breaking of the ship on the rocks. 
    Odysseus had to put some beeswax in his men ears so they couldn't listen to the sirens. 
    He tied up himself to the mast of the ship because he wanted to listen to the sirens's singing. He asked his men to do not untie him until they passed the island.</p>
    <br>
    <bold>SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS</bold>
    <br>
    <p>In order to get home, Odysseus and his men had to pass through two cliffs.
    Shylla lived on one cliff, Charybdis on the other one. Shylla had six heads and it wanted to take six men for each ship that passed by.
     Charybdsid lived under the water and it would come up to take the rest of the men and the whole ship. 
     Odysseus had to make a decision, losing six men or all of them plus his ship.
     He decided to go to Scylla. They trew a lamb to the monster in order to distract it, so Scylla ate it and they made it thru the passing way heading for the next destination.</p>
    <br>
    <bold>THE LAND OF HELIOS</bold>
    <br>
    <p>Helios is the Sun God.
    There was one rule to follow on that island that Odysseus was aware of.
    The men were not allowed to harm the cattle. If they harmed the cattle they would all die, if they didn't, they could all get back home. 
    They ate only the food Circe gave them. 
    Because of the wind they were stuck on the island for over a month. The men started starving to death,so they decided to eat the cattle and that made Helios very very mad. 
    When Odysseus found out what happened, decided to get back to the ship but the bad winds sent the ship back to Scylla and Charybdis, this one ate the ship,but regurgitated some pieces of it and Odysseus could heading off to the sea again.</p>
    <br>
    <bold>OGYGIA-CALYPSO'S ISLAND</bold>
    <br>
    <p>Odysseus ended up on Calypso's island where he spent few years.
     The Goddess didn't want to let him go away because she was in love with him, but Athena eventually asked Zeus to set Odysseus free. Zeus sent Hermes to Calypso telling her that she had to let the man go! 
     Calypso allowed him to leave the island but she tried one last time to keep him there saying 
     "Is she more beautiful than i am, I mean I am a Goddess?" 
     Odysseus replyed: "No one is more beautiful than you, but she is my wife and I need to return home to her"</p>
    <br>
    <bold>SCHERIA-THE ISLAND OF PHAEAIANS</bold>
    <br>
    <p>When Poseidon found out what Zeus had done, he created a storm to destroy Odysseus's ship. Ino,the sea Goddess, came to rescue him putting a veil over him to keep him safe.
     He landed on Scheria,the land of Phaeaians.
      Athena appeared in Nausica's, the princess of that island, dreams that night telling her to go to the riverbank to wash her clothes the morning after.
     Nausica went to the riverbank with some of her handmaidens. Odysseus woke up and noticed them. They were all afraid of him except for Nausica who decided to bring him to her father Alcinous. Alcinous was so impressed by Odysseus that he asked him to marry his daughter. When Odysseus told his story to the king, he gave him a ship that will take him home the next day. So the next day he headed for Ithaca.</p>
    <br>
    <bold>ITHACA</bold>
    <br>
    <p>The situation in Ithaca was changed. 
    Odysseus had to turned himself into an old beggar for two reasons. 
    The first one to see who really was still on his side, the second one to see if Penelope was remained faithful to him.
     Odysseus went to his old friend's house Eumaeus and he found his son Telemachus there.
      Odysseus decided to reveal his identity to him warning him to keep that to himself for a while.
    Odysseus got back to his palace and found out that it was occupied by the suitors. 
    The suitors told Penelope that she had to pick one of them and marry him.
     She agreed saying that she would pick one after finishing up weaving her canvas. Every day she weaved the canvas but every night she used to take back the weaving at the same point it was the day before. That's how she kept the suitors calm.
      When the suitors found out about what Penelope was doing they gave her an ultimatum. So she decided to give an impossible task to the suitors and whoever could make it, he would have become her husband and king of Ithaca.
       The task was to string Odysseus's bow and shoot an arrow thru ten targets in row. No one could do it. Odysseus wanted to try, everyone was laughing because he was just an old beggar. He did it. The servants ,led by an old maide who had recognized her master, closed all the doors so the suitors could't escape and Odysseus and his son finally killed all of them. Then Odysseus went to Penelope to tell her that he was home. Of couse she was suspicious after all those years, so she made him tell her their story about their bed, built years ago by Odysseus himself. Penelope and Odysseus were reunited.</p>
